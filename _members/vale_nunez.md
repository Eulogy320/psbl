I joined the Plant Systems Biology Lab for my Ph.D. in Biological Sciences, focusing on understanding how changes in pectin methylesterification and cell wall properties affect cotyledon cell expansion in response to nitrate. Currently, my Postdoctoral Research aims to integrate genomics, bioinformatics, biomechanics, and cell biology approaches to understand the interplay between nitrate availability and cell wall metabolism in cotyledon growth. This work focuses on early stages of shoot development and growth using the plant model Arabidopsis thaliana.
